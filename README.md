# Description

Stackup editor helps to create stackup diagram for KiCAD PCBs. Stackup diagram may be required for some PCB factories. 

## Do I need this ?

Popular PCB factories usually already have stackup editor embedded into their online order forms, so there is no need for separate diagram. Others will explicitely ask you about stackup. Even then you can just describe stackup in textual form. This program is just for unification and convenience.
